            Teamwork is often a crucial part of a business, as it is often necessary for colleagues to work well
            together, trying their best in any circumstance. <br>
            Teamwork means that people will try to cooperate, using their individual skills and providing constructive
            feedback, despite any personal conflict between individuals.

        <p class="animationClass2">
            Teamwork helps solve problems. Collaboration within a group can help solve difficult problems. <br>
            Brainstorming is a good opportunity for the team to exchange ideas and come up with creative ways of doing
            things. <br>
            By working together, teams can find the solutions that work best

                In the first movie of "The Avenger", none of the heroes know how to work as a team.  Each one of them relied on their own strength and wanted to work by themselves. <br>  
                Due to that reason, one of the good guys died in the movie.  After that incident, they finally realize that teamwork is crucial because working as a team strengthens their own power, and less work for them too. <br>  
                We need to work more as a team so that none of us will die (burnt out)  at i.c.stars.
